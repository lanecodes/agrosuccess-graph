Comment: ,,,"Pine grows everywhere, this might be what leads to Pine being on low fertility land",,"dehesa landscapes are low density oak forest with grazing underneath. because not enough water for high density oak forest. Wouldn’t want low density pine, doesn’t make sense because of other products",,oak produces big branches you can use for building/ ornaments. Difficult to differentiate forest species. Maybe if specific for burning we’re okay here.,,"Oak harder because of hotter fire needed to clean out, and resprouts so would need to pick out roots.",

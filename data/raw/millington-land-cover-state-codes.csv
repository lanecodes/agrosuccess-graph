* SM stands for Supplementary Materials from Millington et al. (2009) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2009.03.013,,,

This table was constructed on 2020-06-02 when James and I noticed inconsistencies between the,,,
land-cover state codes used in Table 4.1 of James’s thesis and those used in the supplementary,,,
materials of Millington et al. (2009). In particular it did not make sense that code 3 only transitioned,,,
to code 5 if 3=deciduous and 5=pasture.,,,
